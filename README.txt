This sideproject is a tool designed to help in programming for strength training by visualizing data about your training
and keeping track of your progress. This project has been inspired by my own needs and interests, and
while there undoubtedly is these kind of tools available, i want to create one myself. My aim here is to learn more about
data processing, visualization tools and development.
